	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>
		As you might have guessed, my name is Adrian Goetz. I am a Software Developer working with the Techrangers at UCF. 
	</p>
	<h3>Interests & Hobbies</h3>
	<h4>Photography</h4>
	<p>I began my photography work with PhotoPass at Disney in 2006, but soon after my interet grew. I quickly saved up for my first DSLR, a Nikon d80, and began experimenting with photography. In addition to artistic photography, I have had a lot of fun doing portraits, fashion and cosplay photography as a hobby.</p>
	<p>As a freelance photographer, I have had the pleasure of capturing many important family events; including but not limited to weddings and engagement photography.</p>
	<h4>Video Games</h4>
	<p>I'm not what I'd call a 'Pro Gamer', but I do dabble quite often. My latest kicks have been Minecraft and Guild Wars, although I have an ever-present itch to play League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, Skyrim and Fallout.</p>
	<h4>Table-Top & Card Games</h4>
	<p>Some people like to hang out at bars, go fishing, or maybe attend a knitting club. My preferred way to spend time with people is around a table, often pretending I'm a Wizard and rolling some dice.</p>
	<p>My favorite social environments:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<h5>Dungeons & Dragons</h5>
			I'm currently playing the roll of Dungeon Master for a group of friends. It's not something I ever would have seen myself getting into about 4 years ago, but it's become one of my major passions and obsessions. No other medium provides such a mix of fun, creativity, and excitement.

			<h5>Pathfinder Adventure Card Game</h5>
			If you don't have the time to devote to a full table-top RPG, this game makes a great substitute. It makes for a fantastic introduction to the genre for novices, but still carries much of the fun of the standard format. It's a great co-op game for anyone who would rather work with their friends than against them.
		</li>
		<li>
			<h5>Magic the Gathering</h5>
			MTG represents to me the pinnacle over-the-top competitive card play. If you ever want an opportunity to test the bonds of friendship against the power of your mind, Magic the Gathering is your best course of action.
