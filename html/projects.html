<h2>Techrangers Psychology Widget Update (2014 - 2015)</h2>
<p>In 2014, the Techrangers were tasked with making Psychology Department’s Pilot Online Project in Undergraduate Psychology (POPUP) Widgets accessible. There were 45 Widgets, all created in Flash, that had to be converted to an HTML format. To replicate the functional feel of the Flash interface, we used an AngularJS framework.</p>
<p>As one of the first members to work on the project, I quickly became the subject matter expert and main point of contact between other Techrangers working on the widgets. In addition to personally developing ten of the widgets, I trained other Techrangers on the proper procedures and formatting for the widgets, organized the team efforts using Basecamp and Google Spreadsheets and made updates to widgets using GitLab. I assigned widgets to Techrangers based on their ability, interests, and current workload, and I implemented the feedback given by the Psychology team into the widgets that were already finished.

<h2>PhotoPass Equipment overhaul (2013 - 2014)</h2>
<p>In 2013, Disney PhotoPass made the conversion from the Nikon D90 to the Nikon D7000. This included over 300 camera rigs deployed in the parks, as well as another hundred in our equipment room storage - over $500k of Nikon supplies. I used care and efficiency in receiving, storing, and processing the new cameras by adding them to our tracking database, and attaching custom components to integrate them with the Disney PhotoPass camera setup.</p>
<p>In addition to processing the cameras themselves, I worked with the PhotoPass deployment bases to develop new storage solutions for the equipment and worked in the park’s off-hours to install the new battery charging systems. Additionally, I tracked each set of cameras in our Cinco Database to ensure they were issued to the correct parks. As an end result, the Coordinators arrived in the morning to find a brand new set of cameras and chargers without having to put in any extra work themselves.</p>
<h2>PhotoPass Holiday Equipment Setup (2013)</h2>
<p>For the Disney’s PhotoPass operation, the winter holidays represent a large spike in activity - with an increase in the type and amount of photography positions. As a member of the equipment team, I spent the months leading up to the holidays communicating with the PhotoPass operations in each Disney theme park in both Florida and California, gathering information on what equipment each location would need to be ready, and what dates they would need them by. I created a comprehensive delivery and setup schedule, maintained communications with the parks in case of changes in their operations, and executed the delivery, setup, and any necessary face to face training for the Cast at each location.</p>
<h2>PhotoPass Special Event Coordinator (2011 - 2013)</h2>
<p>Disney’s Hollywood Studios has two major special events during the year: Star Wars Weekends and The Osborne Family Spectacle of Dancing Lights. During my time as a Coordinator in that park, I was put in charge of these events, which constituted approximately 40-60% of the operation during those times and required a dynamic approach to the operation since each year the event was run differently with new locations and offerings.</p>
<p>The two major roles I played were Operations Coordinator and Equipment Support. I spent the hours leading up the events planning workload for my cast members, and during the events I operated as a mobile troubleshooting unit, checking on each location every 15 minutes and replacing any malfunctioning equipment, to ensure that our photography positions did not lose productivity to equipment errors.</p>
<p>These events involved Cast Members from several departments, so a primary focus was also to communicate and coordinate with other teams in the work area, which involved attending cross-park team meetings and relaying information that would be important to our operation. At the end of each event day, I reported all significant happenings to our leadership to keep them informed of the operation.</p>
<h2>MagicBand Integration (2012)</h2>
<p>In accordance with a company-wide movement, Disney PhotoPass scanners had to migrate from optical  to an RFID system. This meant an update in the PDAs used to accommodate Baracoda scanners; requiring new hardware for the PDA, the implementation of the Baracoda scanner, and a new version of the Rover program that was used to sort photos on the PDA. As a QA Testing Coordinator, my role was to understand the changes being implemented, create training materials, and process feedback from the in-the-field testers. I organized data received from the photographers in the field into daily reports used to fine-tune the technology and demonstrate its effectiveness to the upper management.</p>
